# AndroidDetector

It is your "seven segment detector"
Most interesting file is ColorBlobDetector.java (Nevermind about it's name)

In lines 125-130 are some settings, you should edit it for you (if necessary)

The app has two modes:
  1) camera preview
  2) detection
you can switch between modes by clicking on the screen

Also if you want I can comment the code after barcodes
